# MCU-Power-Optimization-with-STM32L4x
This repo discusses about achieving low power consumption of MCU. STM32L4x is used and optimized algorithm for implementation of power optimization is developed and verified. Current consumption of 35uA-45uA in LP sleep mode with 176.5uA in wake mode has been achieved successfully.
